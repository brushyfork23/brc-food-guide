        "description": "The piece is inspired by the natural balance of organic and geometric properties in nature. The title refers to a red maple tree, a symbol of endurance and the passing of time. The tower, a blend of gothic and modern technology, is meant to combine these notions. The passage of time is important to me, and whether it is my perspective or an objective truth, society as a whole feels to be entering into a new season. It feels like something is ending, but as we pass from autumn into winter, so follows spring.",

But Chilopod comes with a serious message too.\n\nChilopod asks, \"Are humans the pests or the stewards of Earth?\" When her home planet's ecosystem was collapsing, bio-engineers created intergalactic seed pods to grow in foreign soil, with a mission to encourage emerging civilizations to safeguard the health of their home planets. Chilopod landed in the Black Rock Desert and grew into what we see today, a maturing being just learning to communicate with humans. When visitors slide down her spine we pick up her thought-spores so that we might disseminate her ecological message across the world.",

An interconnected canopy creates shadow art on the playa floor, and meandering pathways lead to an opening in the center. Climbable trees and various walkways among the canopy will afford elevated perspective. Just like a real forest, the grove will have its seasons and 24-hour cycles. Paradisium provides a space for respite and reflection while fostering a sense of community and an investment in our shared future.",

Taking alternate turns, each team throws their balls, which are of contrasting colors, toward the pallino. Object of the game is for each team to (A) get one of their balls closest to the pallino, (B) to move the pallino closer to their ball, or (C) move the opponent's ball away from the pallino. The winning team begins the next frame. We will create a self-reporting scoreboard and the Burning Man Covid Ball Championship will be on Man Burn day.",

Once hunted to the brink of extinction, whales are now protected by international law due to individuals coming together to act. This installation demonstrates that an individual can have an impact both on the people around them but also on the planet as a whole.",

As a result, an aesthetically bonding interactive experience is created. We treat Playa as our 6th element, which we employ to promote connection through expression, where burners are be invited to share a moment of wonder. Visually, for most of the day the sun creates a colour spectacle and the night a light performance results in an autonomous environment. It becomes the playa in a translated form that's represented as a triangular prism. There are 4 swings which promote random meetings which allow interaction (outwards) or a moment of shared vulnerability. (inwards)",

When triggered, beams of light will shoot out from four surrounding stone pillars in colors representing Earth, Air, Water and Fire onto the participants on the altar, then a powerful beam of white light will illuminate the participants from below as they kiss or embrace, illuminating the surrounding area as they become the element of love until the lighting effect times out and fades to make space for other participants.",

        "description": "Left-right, boom-bust, liberal-conservative, growth recession, capitalist socialist, this binary choice is a growing point of conflict. Burning man is an experience where self-reliance and communal effort coexist and thrive. Many of us who have experienced this feel classic ideologies are no longer serving us. Building these effigies in a medium that is classically made of paper is a representation of what they are, paper tigers constructs written on paper, not immutable realities. In expressing our feelings about them and burning them down together we can let go of the burden and confinement of ideologies that no longer serve us and be inspired to co-creation a new future.",

Participants live life live (not a typo). One needs to live, but also to do it live & not in a recorded or fake fashion. Too often burners live outside of their reality and not in a present way. Rene Magritte's surrealist art makes the participant question their reality. The text communicates what it is (art) but also what it is not (not a NFT of art). While art exists, it doesn't exist until someone creates some type of physical form. NFTs exist but not in physical form, yet this piece exists as a NFT upon being video'd & made into a NFT, which means what it isn't becomes what it is.",

Inspired by Aetherius, the Greek God of the upper air and light, this sculpture can be played by both humans and the elements. A hexagonal prism of 120 strings comes alive with ethereal music through interaction with desert sun and wind. Sound of Aetherius hugs us with the tonal textures of the desert, and allows all of us to be musicians. It asks us to bow our heads to nature and the magical gifts she can bring us.",

How does interacting with the product of co-creation offer insight and shared wisdom? Arising is one place marker to visibly share our collective experiences and hopes.",

Arranged by proximity to extinction, these creatures form a Danse Macabre procession, spiraling inward toward an elegant portal. One already extinct species lies dark beyond the gateway. The sculptures are united by common materials and a shape language drawn from art nouveau and art deco.\n\nLEDs illuminate each sculpture from within while a hanging flame above each animal represents the creature's vitality and bathes the site in glowing firelight. A composed soundscape compliments the beauty of the physical installation.",

The sign is made out of reclaimed sheet metal and discarded letters from dismantled corporate signs, hand painted, lit by 300 LED bulbs and securely attached to a welded base with wheels (and sometimes, pedal-power). The piece is fully mobile across the playa. You can usually find the BORiNG sign accompanying burns, alongside popular art projects, and framing the silhouette of the Man at sunset. With four 500-watt speakers and a playlist of danceables from the 60s, 70s and 80s, the mobile, rolling sign often attracts an entourage of sunset or late night boogie revelers.",

The case is propped on glowing rocks. Seven glowing rocks circle the coffin. This sculpture enchants and draws people to the mystical space it creates. Emotionally, this sculpture evokes fairytales and that the romantic and eternal sleep of the figure is outside of time and reality. The classical nature of the greek style statue contrasts dramatically with the barren and expansive character of the playa. Light drives the event at night, and every aspect of this piece will be illuminated bringing a soft white light to an otherwise very dark place.",

For those that look closer, the woman will appear within the flames, and for those that look even deeper, it will become apparent that as the noise of the playa increases, so does the intensity of the fire, but the woman, she remains at peace.

        "description": "The Face is an open invitation to face oneself. Collaged from Haeckel's biological illustrations and synced with Rumi's poetic calling, is the airy sculpture of 1D elements. Standing as a symbol of unity, the Face bridges: East & West, spiritual & biological, aquatic & terrestrial, fauna & flora. \n\nAquatic creatures constitute the elements forging the parallax illusion of a genderless portrait collage. Ambient music, sounds of nature, & multilingual echoes of Rumi's call, seduce wandering souls in BRC with a multisensorial composition that awakens the mind.\n\nThe Face beckons to all and guides without advice. The target is meditative dialogue. The process is intentional & incremental: one step at a time, one visitor after the other.",

Each aspect becomes a facet of artwork on its own. Adorned with 3,600 LEDs, this eclectic piece incorporates vibrant acrylic and bright sheet metal with recycled armor plate and reclaimed agricultural pipe. Its 8 elongated petals mechanically pivot overhead atop an 8' steel column like a compass rose. Its foliage naturally diffuses sunlight through 160 panels of chromatic lucite by day while a gradient of colors illuminate outward by night. From the shadow play of crisp silhouettes, to its prismatic light show, Fleur de LUX is visually stunning at any hour.",

It is said that in the universe in which we live is none other than Brahma, who creates the world through his dream, manifesting himself through the minds of mankind. The property of the consciousness of the god is to create reality through thought, as a passive observer of existence. The installation is meant to create a surreal and somnambulistic atmosphere of communication, a place where people meet.",

The open air, jungle gym-like skeleton invites multiple burners to simultaneously climb and walk through the sculpture. The entrance to the piece begins at 20' tall, with the gates consistently contracting to 4' at the center, before again expanding outwards to 20'. The open concept will trace striking geometric shadows across the playa floor during the day. At night LED strips, running lengthwise, display intricate animations that accentuate the contraction and expansion of the gates. These LEDs will be both sound and motion reactive, changing their behavior based on the presence of burners or art cars.",

It was born from a thought experiment that if a human can do Vrksasana, the tree pose in yoga, then can a tree do Sirsasana, a human-centric headstand pose?\n\nSirsasana's beautiful radiating geometry will be covered leaf to roots with sentimental details to explore from Srikanth's childhood home of Hyderabad.",

Geometric perforations resonate outward from the forehead, emitting light from an internal source by night and reflecting the golden interior by day. An opening allows participants to enter inside of the sculpture to discover a wondrous grotto with shimmering golden walls and ledges to sit upon. A magnificent geometric light in the shape of the pineal gland hangs from the center of the head illuminating the sculpture at night. A large open book of empty lined paper with pens invites participants to record their dreams and reflect on their thoughts. Seed of Dreams provides a place for participants to seek refuge, meditate, or connect with their intuition.",

A quick climb up to the apex look out point grants a new perspective of the vibrant alien terrarium and surrounding playa.

It is 24 feet long in longest dimension, and 24 feet wide when \"open  for business\" with shade flaps up.  It will provide approximately 1500 square feet of shade for the cafe experience.  We have long associated with the participant WiFi network and will hopefully be able to provide WiFi again so artists can check in back home when they arrive.  By moving coffee production to our \"Ghost Kitchen\" back in the BLD we will be able to devote all the shade for the purpose of relaxation.   This will hopefully help decompress the ARTery during build week.\n\nThe tent is fully self supporting.  There are no trip wires.",

Here we leave space for interpretation. Everyone can invent their own legend. We only present an image, and we invite people to give it meaning and stories.\n\nMost of Diptown is hidden beneath the surface, in both the physical and metaphorical senses. Like an iceberg, it projects only a few feet above the surface. It will be up to imagine what else exists below the surface. It will up to viewers to fill in the rest of the details.",

        "description": "The artwork is a large modular sculpture of half a wooden peg made from a series of steel galvanised pipes. It is called the Resurrection of the Clothes Peg and is an ode the resurgence of the female voice. The monumental form of an ordinary household item like a wooden peg is meant to evoke a sense of criticality questioning why such a rudimentary form is given such importance. There is a clear dichotomy of male and female energies as the form is heavy and solid and erect - almost phallic, yet the message is about feminine strength. The item represented is a reference to female domestic chores and its function of holding and supporting.",

The slightest change in perspective creates an evolution in form, which will be seen from great distances, especially at night.  The three layers create valleys that participants can walk through, shifting focus from layers to an internal landscape.  Motion sensors set at the ends, and in other locations, will act as gateways, activating waves of complimentary colors through the more stable slow evolution of color in fiber optic systems lining every vertical element.  The work is meant to reflect on the complexity of layering energy and relationships, which shifts with only the slightest change",

We can come to understand that to change the smallest part is to change the nature of the whole. Finding balance within duality is where we can find the courage to set ourselves free, to be who we've always felt we are.\n\nSimultaneously singular & infinite; separate & connected.",

This causes the molecules to repeat into a large structure. however the result is not just a neat cube over a neat cube. The crystals jut out at 45 degrees, in an almost anti-gravity fashion. They can balance on the point because of tensegrity, as the stress of the structure is equally distributed to all of its points. When a person interacts with the sculpture, either by crawling inside during the day or playing with the shadow and light at night, they will be come a part of the geometry themselves, seeing the shadows reflecting on their skin and the land around them",

This piece is about experiencing new perspectives together in the hopes of realizing how perspective, which is to say our experiences, shapes our day to day understanding of the world around us.",

The cards have manifested as portals into feminine wisdom. A host of witches, maidens, mothers, and crones reach out through transcendent images of photographic magic to deliver messages of poetic healing. Four outposts at the four compass directions embody the minor arcana, the characters and scenarios of life's endless stories. At their center are twenty-two doors, each leading inward to the primal light of consciousness by way of the major arcana, the ultimate symbols of life's infinite transformative power. Each sunset calls a mysterious cast of time travelers to light the central fire.",

Inside the cone are interactive, mechanical \"widgets.\" Participants manipulate the widgets, causing patterns of light to dance across the LEDs. Some widgets drive colored lines and rings while others create sparkles or showers of color droplets.",

You have been admitted to The Pythagorean Institute, Class of 2026!\nYou were accepted because your application has shown your ability to be molded into the person we want you to become. Despite your profound intellect you appear to be quite gullible and emotionally sensitive. How we are perceived by others is mortally important to us. \n TPI has existed since 520 BCE, so we are quite certain about what we want to achieve. Whereas we believe in facts, as a bonus, if you graduate our 16 year program with honors, you will earn the power to transmigrate. Your soul can thereafter freely pass into a different body after your death. \n Kudos! Cecelia Payne, Dean of Students   Go Kakapos!",

Each one spins in the wind or by human activation and has an electro-mechanical assembly within that resonates three metal bar chimes that are tuned to produce a three-note harmonic chord.  The elements are designed to cause a warbling sound as they spin, which is referred to, in musical terms, as a Tremolo.

Visitors to the deep playa will find this funny character by the light of his solar LED balloon, looking for the party.\nThis artwork represents our memories, loved, past and future. The embodiment of the ghost is a metaphor for the things we often can't pin down, the places we long to visit, things altered by time or things that have drifted away. This ghost is waiting in the dust to remember you, and show you the way back to a different time.",

Barbie is a plastic aesthetic that degrades the Burning Man culture with a false identity and unrealistic proportions.\n\nIf we love ourselves, honor those that create love and not what defines eating disorders. If we must pretend to be others, at least let it be a revolutionary countercultural visionary.\n\nThen, like all great Burning Man art pieces, climb inside, learn about Larry, take a selfie and depart for other shiny sparkly things.",

        "description": "It is no secret that burning man attracts the elite of the world. It is also no secret that our planet is in the worst shape it has ever been. There is way too much carbon in the air, carbon released by the burning of fossil fuels that has been stored in the ground for millennia. When the sun hits these molecules they vibrate, creating energy that is warming up the planet. The logical solution would be to slash carbon emissions, and focus all our energy on healing ecosystems to bring down carbon levels in the air. However, the data shows that the richest 10% of the planet account for 52% of emissions, and the richest 1% emit more than double the emissions of the poorest half of humanity. It's time for radical honesty.",

This smiling six-limbed goddess with compound eyes, delicate antennae, and silky metal leg fringe, anal gills, and cercus is a warrior insect from another dimension. Her inquisitive antennae and six limbs swimmingly stir the air, simultaneously producing music: deep gongs and chimes as people, small below the huge stonefly, pull ropes at the base of the structure. The small action below causing large action above reminds us of the importance of small things.",

        "description": "Dreaming Under a Desert Sky is at its simplest a bed in the desert & at its finest a place of reprieve, connection, & inspiration. Colorful fabric pieces flutter from the canopy in the desert air during the day. At night, a rainbow of lights frame the playa. Laughter, beats, fire-breathing art cars provide the soundtrack. People are drawn to this resting place, whether by the white steed of a bed in the austere desert & bit of shade provided during the day or by the dreamy lights of the bed at night. While there, people pile onto the bed &, inspired by the surroundings, they share their dreams with others. 'Dreaming' invites all people to pause in their journey. And here, people don't sleep to dream but wake to live their dreams.",

The project references the artistic styles from this area of ancient Africa but with the massing, geometry, and materiality rooted in contemporary times. As a movement, Afrofuturism envisions 'tomorrow' by exploring cultural and design aesthetics between the arts, history, science-fiction, and politics from African and African diasporic lens. The Ancient Egyptians and Nubians believed that the sun was a deity, Ra, and had metaphysical powers as the giver of life on Earth and creator of the universe. The design is futuristic with clean lines, subtle angles, and large panels which also give it a 'megalithic' appearance.",

        "description": "SKUM is a large inflatable sculpture mimicking foam, clouds or formations of distant universes. SKUM is the Danish word for foam\u2013a word that encapsulates the installation's playful dialogue & interaction between burners and their surrounding landscape. SKUM\u2013like foam-is at once physical & ethereal.\n\nDuring the day, SKUM provides shelter from the sun. At night, SKUM is illuminated by lightning strikes within the structure. When a sound \u2013 man-made or natural - occurs in the vicinity of SKUM, the lightning strikes cease \u2013 only starting back up once the quiet serenity returns. This immersive experience challenges burners to moments of quiet reflection \u2013 to be experienced in either solitude, or together as a group.",

I turn to my friend and at the same time we both exclaim, \"This is the coolest place I've ever been.\" We spy in the distance lights and sounds of deep chimes. Could this get any better? We make our way past crowds of similarly effected people and find ourselves in front of a strange structure. We push the activation device and the art piece comes to life. Multiple pyramid faces of various themes light up in individual sequences and chimes sound above our heads!  A fish, rocket ship, palm tree, (an eggplant?), a planet surround by stars.....why so many different thoughts and meanings? This is something we'll discuss for the rest of the night.",

Taking photos for one's personal brand or to commodify their own or others' burn is bad. Instagram and social media won't disappear, but cacaphony and absurdity is the root of Burning Man.

This year there will be 80 TiKis out on the phence with odd unique items dangling  from the bottom of each wooden  TiKi. As always all objects are recycled, repurposed, self created. Sustainable, the rods used to support the weird stuff, will be used for the 20th time, including many regionals. This year there will be objects from many cultures around the world from Bhutan to Africa. While you ride along the phence you will enjoy the great variety and connect personally with more than one.  Dragnet makes it more than a phence its an unexpected playa palette!",

There is a recording device 5 feet high on the lamp pole where burners can interact with the art work by recording snarky comments into the audio system to be played back when the next burner triggers the motion sensor. Overall, the concept of the piece invites burners to interact directly with an artwork, using the visual/audio impact of well lit colorful streetlight to share the long tradition of burner snark.",

Is FIRE friend or foe; teacher, healer, provider or malevolent force? Accompanying  the grove an interactive altar provides a space for 2D art and written word responses to the questions.",

Playa Nebula is both seen and experienced; neither one without the other. It invites the viewer into a participatory act; first with the piece itself, second with surrounding environment. It acts as a place to connect to one another & witness the desert as universe. The soft-scape provided affords a place for participants to sit, climb, & play. It will allow for moments of internal reflections, for small intimate moments, & for inclusive social interaction.",

It is an object of focus in a vast expanse, meant to bring people, separate or together, into a nexus of time and space. The Now. A place to confront existential dread with an appeal to the immediacy of the moment, a view of a horizon toward the future, and a reckoning and reflection of the past. Hard questions may arise. But so too, wonder and awe, and maybe understanding and hope. In this moment we can ask ourselves, What's The Point ?",

When The Fragile NO is approached two bright security flood lights will go on. It will be obvious they have just approached a big NO. If they try to climb on it they will find that this NO is actually fragile and might not last through the whole burn. What will the Burner community do with it?

The enclosed, intimate moments absorb and play with sound, while also providing a refuge amongst the happenings of the 7:30 Plaza.\n\nEnvironmental sustainability is at the heart of this project's material selection. The structural beams are made of repurposed trampoline parts with woven fabric tubing stuffed with straw, a material that will be returned back to the land within the artist's local community after use.  \n\nThe use of weaving in this art installation can elicit a sense of familiarity and belonging, while we return to nature, our bodies, senses and each other.",

Additionally, the spiritual entities affecting each participant will be enlisted in sustaining the healing and embodiment of R.I.D.E. \nBurning of the totem is intentionally simple, restoring focus to primitive fires ancestors held ceremony with and the rising phoenix empowers regeneration and healing.",

The Book-End Bulk-Up Challenge BAN-nanza is the perfect way to get that stress off your chest. With dozens of books, a barbell and a weight bench, work-out buffs can exercise by bench pressing books of oppression to help lift up intellectual elevation. If you don't want to work out, have a sit in the comfy chair after choosing a comfort blankie from the comfy chest. All book boxes are active library exchange zones. There is a crucial need to bring mental & physical awareness to literature, free speech, and the censorship used to restrict access to information. Books make us better as a society.

The house becomes a church of ideas that have died and long passed.  The cast figures upon the staircase is a theatre, or a play.  The interplay of figures tell their own stories.  The figures will also be ornate as structures of antiquity.    Secretly Abandoned Spaces in a museum of stories that have been lost in antiquity.",

Inside a kinetic sculpture contemplates: \"Can the creativity, memories, and love of a person fit within a single suitcase?\"\n\nJay went through a phase in 2010 where he used a large pink suitcase as a briefcase even though it was much too large for the purpose. He playfully refused to let anyone see inside. The interior sculpture is made from that very suitcase along with many keepsakes, photos, letters, and objects owned by Jay or linked to his life - all aiming to capture his totally unique and dynamic spirit.  Provided headphones play audio of Jay's friends telling stories about him.",

Backlit screens will demonstrate the moire pattern as the outer screen rotates around the pipe. There will also be a zoetrope built into the pipe and will have a viewing piece that will give it a old time peep show feel.  The illustrations on the zoetrope will be done by several different artists and we will be able to change the art easily during the event.\nPipe Dreams is an attempt to create a new piece that has the feel of machines that were made in the late 1800's.",

        "description": "The Arising Phoenix is a 14-foot tall sculpture of a bird, welded from tools, utensils and other objects that went through the Campfire in 2018.  The artist, Wizzard, and his wife, AttaGirl, collected items off their property, as well as neighbors and friends who wanted to donate objects to be included in the piece.  The artist said the vision of the piece was the strongest he had ever had. It is a symbolic representation of the tools that are needed to rebuild Paradise, CA, and the surrounding area that was also devastated by the fire.",

The Seed of Life is a universal symbol of creation. Found at the heart of an ancient symbol called the Flower of Life, there is an entire cosmology of consciousness encoded into this singular geometric seed. In essence, the Seed of Life symbol, with its seven interconnected circles, symbolizes the interconnection of life on Earth and universal existence. It also symbolizes that all life originated from a single source in a divine plan. The name, \"Genesis\" quite literally means - an origin, creation, or beginning.",

Various patinas and other metal types add texture and color to help define the patterns, designs and motifs that make up the panels. Fine details to appreciate by day will be lit at night by colored LED spotlights to create infinitely variable patterns. Wind-driven outstretched wings will rotate around the center pole, giving the sculpture a kinetic aspect. Flame effects will be at the top, on the wings and on the ground.",

This years exploration brings us to an interplay between Kokopelli and Coyote, imagined in metal and prose. The metal is a physical monument to existence. The prose is a parable on the value, cost, effects, and interplay of Trickery and Deceit. A few of the Parable we are working on include the ideas of \" F--- me once, shame on you, Fool me twice, shame on me\". \"Reaching for the Unobtainable, in our waking dreams\", The Sly Thief parable, The Parable of Strength and Honor, The Parable of Cooperation and Goodwill, The Idea of How to Titillate an Ocelot, the Parable of \"Is it better to be Lucky than Smart.\" There is more..",

The trees are to be arranged on a square grid, 10 trees by 10 trees, placed in concentrically smaller grids and culminating in an open area at the center. The forest will be bathed in dancing LED lights of multitude of colors shining through the shaped cutouts in the trees.   Citizens of Black Rock Desert will be able to see the forest for miles.   My hope is the forest will be placed in deep playa past the temple so it will be dark enough for the forest to shine.  Our hope is for participants will interact with the forest in the most magical way.   As one will enter the forest, the will find a world of colorful beauty where one can let go, dance, be silly, discover a new more playful self.   As an installation artist my goal is to create art that is experiential.  With the Forest, participants not only physically walk through and explore the piece, they get lost in the space and become one with the forest.",

But how do you repair a broken heart?\nSentinels protect the heart with vigilant eyes.  Within these Guardians, you can research the artifacts of pain, loss, guilt and shame.  Each token is a memorial to a heart wrenching story.  The Guardians turn these artefacts into bricks used to protect the heart by building a wall around it.  But while walls protect, they cannot heal a broken heart.  \nWhen it is time to heal, we turn to nature.  The heart's forest feeds the heart.  The larger-than-life rotating heart knows what medicine it needs- what medicine you need: love, connection, gratitude.  Each tree will help you on your journey.",

Here, our individual reflections in each 'facet' of the multitude of lens-like convex mirror are framed with everyone else' into a mosaic portrait of shared reflection, pointing us to the stars, literally and symbolically",

Best experienced under the Playa's blazing daytime sun, this light-refractive art installation is a home-spun cathedral designed to embellish the beauty of our solar system's resident star. Lovingly made from upcycled and reclaimed materials, Astrofengi\u00e1's frame and walls provide respite from desert heat. Semi-transparent shade and reflective surfaces glistening in sunlight create an enclosed space that houses a lattice-like floor-to-ceiling central chandelier. Comfortable seating may be augmented with headphones with which participants enjoy soundscapes crafted from NASA archives and custom designed sound. Philosophically, Astrofengi\u00e1 contemplate starlight's circuitous call luring Earth's human life forms back to outer space.",
